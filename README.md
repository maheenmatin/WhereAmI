- On an eerily chilly night, you awake in a cemetery with no memory of how you got there. A single thought claws at the very fabric of your being: there is somewhere you need to be...
- You attempt to leave the cemetery, only to find you are immediately transported back to the entrance! You try again and again to no avail.
- At the height of your desperation, an angel-like figure descends from the night sky and says that you can leave any time you want. In the blink of an eye, you have been transformed into a grey-haired swordsman with purple armour! 
- Ominously, she declares that she "won't help you anymore". Suddenly, you find yourself transported to a nightmarish world full of demons! How will you survive?
